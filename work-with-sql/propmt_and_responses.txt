Call_1:

Let's restart that check. 
Ok, good job.
Let's go to next step.
I have a table in @https://sqliteonline.com/ , named orders. Do you have access to it? If yes, please describe me these table.


Response_1:

I don't have direct access to your specific table in sqliteonline.com. While I can see that sqliteonline.com is a web-based SQL editor and database management tool, I cannot see your particular database and tables.
To help you with your table, you would need to:
Share the table structure (schema) with me
Or share a screenshot/description of the table
Or share the CREATE TABLE statement used to create it
Once you provide any of this information, I'll be able to help you work with your orders table. Would you please share some details about your table structure?

Call_2: 

Ok, lets work next way.
I have next table:
CREATE TABLE orders (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    customer TEXT,
    amount REAL,
    order_date DATE
);

INSERT INTO orders (customer, amount, order_date) VALUES
('Alice', 5000, '2024-03-01'),
('Bob', 8000, '2024-03-05'),
('Alice', 3000, '2024-03-15'),
('Charlie', 7000, '2024-02-20'),
('Alice', 10000, '2024-02-28'),
('Bob', 4000, '2024-02-10'),
('Charlie', 9000, '2024-03-22'),
('Alice', 2000, '2024-03-30');

Please provide sqls and results (for values provided above) for next tasks:
1) calculate the total sales volume for March 2024.
2) search for a customer, who spent the most overall
3) calculate the average order value for the last three months


Response_2:

I'll help you with these SQL queries and provide the expected results for your dataset.
1) Total sales volume for March 2024:

SELECT SUM(amount) as march_total 
FROM orders 
WHERE strftime('%Y-%m', order_date) = '2024-03';

Expected result:

march_total
-----------
31000      (5000 + 8000 + 3000 + 9000 + 2000)

// @LevGordienko: in test descr it should be 27000???

2) Customer who spent the most overall:

SELECT customer, SUM(amount) as total_spent
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 1;

Expected result:

customer    total_spent
---------   -----------
Alice       20000      (5000 + 3000 + 10000 + 2000)

3) Average order value for the last three months (considering the data spans February-March 2024):

SELECT AVG(amount) as avg_order_value
FROM orders
WHERE order_date >= date('2024-03-31', '-3 months');

Expected result:

avg_order_value
--------------
6000          (48000 total / 8 orders)

Explanations:
For March sales, we use strftime to extract year-month and compare it with '2024-03'
For the biggest spender, we GROUP BY customer, sum their amounts, and order by total spent descending
For the 3-month average, since all data is within Feb-March 2024, it includes all orders. The total sum (48000) divided by number of orders (8) gives us 6000 average
Would you like me to explain any of these queries in more detail or modify them in any way?
